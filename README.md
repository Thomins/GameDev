You have a certain amount of time to steal these objects.
```diff

```
#### Why do it?
A strange organization has taken your family hostage. You have one objective **Save them**. (There's also the bonus of having fun)

#### How will you do it?
You have a special tool that gives you the ability to see out of the security guard cameras. Don't be fooled. THEY ARE STILL WATCHING.
If you are caught in a camera for longer then the limit they sound the alarms.
You will also need to avoid being seen by a guard patrolling the area.

## How to play?
Controls are pretty simple.
**Movement**
	- Left Click in a spot close to your character
**Abilities**
	- (undetermined, but you will be able to use them)
**Pause Menu**
	- Esc

### I think that is it :D
